# illustrate

---

    The increase or decrease of the entire list of data is processed by the use layer. The components donâ€™t need to know what your data structure is
    No matter what you do to your array (push, pop ....)
    Or when you modify the content of a certain element, you just need to tell the component how many data you have,
    This is the method of superlayout.total

# Interface

-   SuperLayout.total (length: Number) This method is to tell the component how many data you have. Whenever you add deletion or your array length has not changed, but the content of your array has changed. You can call this method to refresh this method.
-   SuperLayout.scrolltoheader rolled to the starting location
-   SuperLayout.scrolltofooter rolled to the end position
-   SuperLayout.scrolltoindex rolled to the specified location
